/* This initialization file has been adapted from the excerpt below for the purposes of our TradeX asset portfolio management application.
It was worked on by Michael Nicholas along with the two partners mentioned below. I've retained the original documentation with quotes.

"This file can be used to initialize a basic sample library dataset.
   It creates the database, the table structure, and includes a few records
   for each table.
   Developed by Luke - 4/15/2019 
   Updated by Luke 4/16/2019 - created stored procedure for checking in books
   Updated by Natalie 4/22/2019 - added to checking in stored procedure but it still generates errors"
